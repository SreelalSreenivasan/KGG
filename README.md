# KGG
Kinetic Gabriel Graphs with non-linear and linear trajectories. Application provides an interface to construct a Delaunay triangulation from a point set and mark Gabriel edges while the points are in motion.

Input:
File 1- Point cordinates supplied in two columns.
File 2- Velocity for selected points are supplied in a single column, as pairs.

Usage:

Use the widgets for uploading and controlling. First file loader for points and second one for loading velocity vector.

Use widget show Gabriel to mark Gabriel edges in the Delaunay Triangulation. Play buttons for both linear and non-linear functions are provided. Once checked, points will move in the corresponding trajectory.
